# SVFB-GUI - Stardew Valley Fishing Bot
*A python 3.6 program for a fully autonomous fishing bot. Work in progress.*

## How it will work (hopefully):

The script will capture the frames from the game where the fishing bar is at and automatically send it to our server. After many frames captured from all users, it will train a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to play the game for you.
You can also train one CNN locally, but it will probably suck, as you wont be able to change many settings and your dataset will be smaller than ours.

As we are still learning how to do all of this, we are probably doing many things wrong, so it will take a while for the projects completion.
